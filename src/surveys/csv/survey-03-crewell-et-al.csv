Timestamp,The field of psychology has problems replicating results,Replication of research is only a problem in the field of psychology,The incentive structure in psychological research can undermine the broader goals of science,The results from studies with low statistical power are by definition incorrect,Researchers who perform replication studies are not qualified to conduct psychological research,It is important for a researcher to report all measures and experimental conditions that were included in a study,"For a researcher, how important is choosing a sample size before running a study?",How important is it to make data publicly available so that results can be verified by other researchers?,"How important are decisions in data collection, analysis, and reporting in affecting how likely a researcher will find a significant effect?",How important is it to report studies that “don’t work out?”,"How important is it that results from a psychology study are counterintuitive (e.g., different from what you would expect)?",Any comments?
