## Last time...

*Questionable research practices*

## Defensible choice or questionable practice?

- In a paper, failing to report all of a study’s dependent measures
- Deciding whether to collect more data after looking to see whether the results were significant
- In a paper, failing to report all of a study’s conditions
- Stopping collecting data earlier than planned because one found the result that one had been looking for

---

- In a paper, “rounding off” a *p* value (e.g., reporting that a *p* value of .054 is less than .05)
- In a paper, selectively reporting studies that “worked”
- Deciding whether to exclude data after looking at the impact of doing so on the results
- In a paper, reporting an unexpected finding as having been predicted from the start
- In a paper, claiming that results are unaffected by demographic variables (e.g., gender) when one is actually unsure (or knows that they do)
- Falsifying data

## More on @simmons_false-positive_2011

- Researcher choices can inflate false positive rates
- Collecting more data after analyzing a small initial sample inflates the false positive rate
- Just because a statistical test met the criterion threshold ($\alpha$) with a small sample doesn't mean it will do so with larger samples

## Recommendations

## Today

*Work Session: P-hacking and Final Project Proposals*

- [Exercise 05: P-hack your way to scientific glory](../exercises/ex05-p-hacking.qmd) write-up.
- Final project [proposals](../exercises/final-project.qmd) 
    
## Set-up for group discussion...

- Enter (anonymized) data into a spreadsheet

<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXcBrI_bMP_wFi1BurCS5WGppr9HWBiF5ulh7ch61MU/edit?usp=sharing>

- Choose a student_id (integer) for yourself (not your PSU ID or phone number)

# Evaluating *p*-hacking

## Our results

- Who got a "significant" result?
- How many different analyses did you try?
- Who changed their analysis after finding a significant result?
- Did anyone try another analysis--after you got a significant result--and *keep* the non-significant result?
- [Visualizations](../supplemental/p-hacking-suppl.qmd) of the data

---

- Do we have good evidence about which party harms or helps the economy?
- Why or why not?
- What is *p*-hacking?
- Did you *p*-hack? Did another classmate? Why do you think so?
