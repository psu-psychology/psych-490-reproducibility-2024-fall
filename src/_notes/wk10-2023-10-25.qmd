Which of the practices recommended in [Table 1 from @munafo_manifesto_2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021/tables/1) recommended practices would be at the *top* of your to-do list if you were a journal editor/publisher, funder, institution (college or university), or regulator (e.g., government entity)? Why?

Which would be at the *bottom* of your list? Why?

What's missing from the list?

What can students, who aren't yet editors, funders, institutions, or regulators do?
