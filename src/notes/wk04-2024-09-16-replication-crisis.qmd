# Overview

## Announcements

  - [Exercise 02: Textbook Findings](../exercises/ex02-textbook-findings.qmd)
- [due Friday, October 4]{.orange_due} 
  - [Exercise 03: Norms and counter-norms write-up](../exercises/ex03-norms-counternorms.qmd) 
    
## Last time...

- Our (partial) replication of [@Kardash2012-kq] via [Survey-02](../surveys/survey-02.qmd)
- Our predictions:
  - Norms vs. counternorms?
  - Should do vs. actually do?
- Are ratings continuous or not?
- Tables and figures: Which is better?

## Today

*A replication crisis (or not)*

- Discuss
    - [@Ritchie2020-fm, Chapter 2], Chapter 2. [PDF on Canvas](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2280122/files/folder/readings?preview=151876802).
    - [@Begley2012-cr].
    
# A replication crisis (or not)
    
## What proportion of findings in the published scientific literature (in the fields you care about) are *actually true*?

- 100%
- 90%
- 70%
- 50%
- 30%

## How do we define what "*actually true*" means?

## Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

## Final Project idea

These questions could form the basis of a final project where a student or students re-run the survey with a different sample.
:::

## What do the terms mean?

>*Replication* refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding with different data... 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]

---

>*Robustness* refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding using the same data and a different analysis strategy....

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]
</p>

---

>*Reproducibility* refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding using the same data and the same analysis strategy...

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]
</p>

---

> In principle, **all reported evidence should be reproducible**. If someone applies the same analysis to the same data, the same result should occur...

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]
</p>

---

>Reproducibility tests can fail for two reasons. A **process reproducibility failure** occurs when the original analysis cannot be repeated because of the unavailability of data, code, information needed to recreate the code, or necessary software or tools...

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]
</p>

---

>...An **outcome reproducibility failure** occurs when the reanalysis obtains a different result than the one reported originally. This can occur because of an error in either the original or the reproduction study.

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Nosek2022-hv]
</p>

## *Methods* reproducibility

- Enough details about materials & methods recorded (& reported)
- Same results with same materials & methods

## Questions to consider
Do the [Survey-01](../surveys/survey-01.html) and [Survey-02](../surveys/survey-02.html) documents demonstrate *methods* reproducibility? Why or why not?

More discussion on [Friday](../schedule.qmd#friday-september-20).
:::

## *Results* reproducibility

- Same results from an independent study

<p style="text-align:center;">

::: {.callout-tip}
## Questions to consider
Is [Survey-02](../surveys/survey-02.qmd) an independent study relative to [@Kardash2012-kq]?
Are our results similar to [@Kardash2012-kq]?

Deep dive on [Friday](../schedule.qmd#friday-september-20). 
:::

## *Inferential* reproducibility

- Same inferences from one or more studies or reanalyses

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@goodman_what_2016]
</p>

---

::: {.callout-tip}
## Questions to consider

How many studies or re-analyses are needed before we decide an effect is real?

If $n>>1$^[$>>$ means 'much greater than'.], how should we think about novel findings?

>We investigated the reproducibility of the major statistical conclusions drawn in 46 articles published in 2012 in three APA journals.

## Question to consider

Is @Artner2021-qg an example of what @Nosek2022-hv call *replication*, *robustness*, or *reproducibility*?
:::

---

::: {.callout-tip}
# Questions to consider

If [@Artner2021-qg] had to "deviate from the article's analytical description" for 18 claims, what does that mean?

Should we reduce the "successfully reproduced" claims to $(163-18)/232 = 62.5%$%?
:::

---

>...The reproduction successes were often the result of cumbersome and time-consuming trial-and-error work, suggesting that APA style reporting in conjunction with raw data makes numerical verification at least hard, if not impossible.

# Discussion of [@Begley2012-cr]

## Reproducibility in pre-clinical cancer biology

- Reading: [@Begley2012-cr](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/483531a)
- [C. Glenn Begley bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Glenn_Begley)

---

::: {.callout-note}
The Center for Open Science (COS) conducted a Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology study. Dr. Errington [visited Penn State in August 2023](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023/presentation-topics.html#keynote) and talked about the eye-opening results [@Errington2021-sy; @Errington2021-dp].

This could be the focal point of a final project.
:::

## Background


> The scientific community assumes that the claims in a preclinical study can be taken at face value — that although there might be some errors in detail, the main message of the paper can be relied on and the data will, for the most part, stand the test of time. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Begley2012-cr]
</p>

---

> Over the past decade, before pursuing a particular line of research, scientists (including C.G.B.) in the haematology and oncology department at the biotechnology firm Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, tried to confirm published findings related to that work. Fifty-three papers were deemed 'landmark' studies (see 'Reproducibility of research findings'). 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Begley2012-cr]
</p>

---

>...It was acknowledged from the outset that some of the data might not hold up, because papers were deliberately selected that described something completely new, such as fresh approaches to targeting cancers or alternative clinical uses for existing therapeutics. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Begley2012-cr]
</p>

---

>Nevertheless, scientific findings were confirmed in only 6 (11%) cases. Even knowing the limitations of preclinical research, this was a shocking result.

| Journal Impact Factor | $n$ articles | Mean number of citations for non-reproduced articles | Mean number of citations of reproduced articles |

| 5-19 | 32 | 168 [6, 1,909] | 13 [3, 24] |

: [@Begley2012-cr] {#tbl-begley}


## Findings

- Findings of 6/53 published papers (11%) could be reproduced
- Original authors often could not reproduce their own work
- Earlier paper [@Prinz2011-vo] had also found low rate of reproducibility. Paper titled "Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets?"

> We received input from 23 scientists (heads of laboratories) and collected data from 67 projects, most of them (47) from the field of oncology. This analysis revealed that only in ∼20–25% of the projects were the relevant published data completely in line with our in-house findings

- Published papers (that can't be reproduced) are cited hundreds or thousands of times
- Cost of irreproducible research estimated in billions of dollars [@Freedman2015-ki].

---

> An analysis of past studies indicates that the cumulative (total) prevalence of irreproducible preclinical research exceeds 50%, resulting in approximately US$28,000,000,000 (US$28B)/year spent on preclinical research that is not reproducible—in the United States alone.

## Questions to ponder {#sec-questions}

- Why do @Begley2012-cr focus on a journal's impact factor?
- Why do @Begley2012-cr focus on citations to reproduced vs. non-reproduced articles?
- Why should non-scientists care?
- Why should scientists (and students) in other fields (not cancer biology) care?
