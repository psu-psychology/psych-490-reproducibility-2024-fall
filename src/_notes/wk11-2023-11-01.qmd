# Meta-analysis

- Multiple studies, ideally published and unpublished (why?)
- What is the distribution of effect sizes?
- Related to [Cochrane Systematic Reviews](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/about/about-cochrane-reviews)

## Example

van Agteren, J., Iasiello, M., Lo, L., Bartholomaeus, J., Kopsaftis, Z., Carey, M. & Kyrios, M. (2021). A systematic review and meta-analysis of psychological interventions to improve mental wellbeing. *Nature Human Behaviour*. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01093-w>.

---

>Our current understanding of the efficacy of psychological interventions in improving mental states of wellbeing is incomplete. This study aimed to overcome limitations of previous reviews by examining the efficacy of distinct types of psychological interventions, irrespective of their theoretical underpinning, and the impact of various moderators, in a unified systematic review and meta-analysis. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Van_Agteren2021-al]
</p>

---

>Four-hundred-and-nineteen randomized controlled trials from clinical and non-clinical populations (*n* = 53,288) were identified for inclusion. Mindfulness-based and multi-component positive psychological interventions demonstrated the greatest efficacy in both clinical and non-clinical populations. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Van_Agteren2021-al]
</p>

---

>Meta-analyses also found that singular positive psychological interventions, cognitive and behavioural therapy-based, acceptance and commitment therapy-based, and reminiscence interventions were impactful. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Van_Agteren2021-al]
</p>

---

>Effect sizes were moderate at best, but differed according to target population and moderator, most notably intervention intensity. The evidence quality was generally low to moderate. While the evidence requires further advancement, the review provides insight into how psychological interventions can be designed to improve mental wellbeing.

## Flaws with meta-analysis

- Garbage-in, garbage-out?
- What about publication bias?

---

>**Policy Points**:
>
>- Currently, there is massive production of unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily produced publishable units or marketing tools.
>- Suboptimal systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the major prestige and influence these types of studies have acquired.

>**Conclusions**
>
>The production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has reached epidemic proportions. Possibly, the large majority of produced systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unnecessary, misleading, and/or conflicted.

Silberzahn, R., Uhlmann, E. L., Martin, D. P., Anselmi, P., Aust, F., Awtrey, E., Bahník, Š., Bai, F., Bannard, C., Bonnier, E., Carlsson, R., Cheung, F., Christensen, G., Clay, R., Craig, M. A., Dalla Rosa, A., Dam, L., Evans, M. H., Flores Cervantes, I., … Nosek, B. A. (2018). Many analysts, one data set: Making transparent how variations in analytic choices affect results. *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*, *1*(3), 337–356. <https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747646>

---

>What if scientific results are highly contingent on subjective decisions at the analysis stage? In that case, the process of certifying a particular result on the basis of an idiosyncratic analytic strategy might be fraught with unrecognized uncertainty (Gelman & Loken, 2014), and research findings might be less trustworthy than they at first appear to be (Cumming, 2014). Had the authors made different assumptions, an entirely different result might have been observed (Babtie, Kirk, & Stumpf, 2014).

## Abstract

>Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Silberzahn2018-st]
</p>

---

>Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship.

Odds ratios (OR) [@Szumilas2010-uj]:

- OR < 1: Outcome *less* likely than comparison
- OR = 1: Outcome and comparison equally likely
- OR > 1: Outcome *more* likely than comparison

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio) also has a thorough discussion.

>Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates.

>Note: The results shown are from the final survey. Each item concerned whether there is a relationship between players’ skin tone and the number of red-card decisions they receive. The response scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The items have been paraphrased for inclusion in the table.

---

>Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Silberzahn2018-st]
</p>

---

>These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.

## Your turn

::: {.callout-note title = "Your thoughts?"}

- So, are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players?
- How is this approach related to *p*-hacking?
- How does the many analysts approach conflict with current practice?
- When does this approach make sense and when doesn't it make sense?

>...Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Botvinik-Nezer2020-wr]
</p>

---

>This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline.

<p style="text-align:center;">
[@Botvinik-Nezer2020-wr]

>Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data.
