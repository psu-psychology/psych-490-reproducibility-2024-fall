# How to read a scientific paper

## Suggestions from [@Carey2020-ut]

- Pick your reading goal
- Understand the author(s) goal

## Suggestions from [@Carey2020-ut]

- Ask six questions:
  (1) What do the author(s) want to know? 
  (2) What did they do? 
  (3) Why was it done that way? 
  (4) What do the results show? 
  (5) How did the author(s) interpret the results? 
  (6) What should be done next?

## Suggestions from [@Carey2020-ut]

- Unpack each figure and table
- Understand the formatting intentions
- Be critical
- Be kind
- Be ready to go the extra mile
- Talk about it
- Build on it

## Gilmore's "inside-out" suggestions

- Abstract
- Then methods
- Then results, especially figures
- Highlight/look up jargon
- Conclusion, then introduction

## Other thoughts

- Claims
  - Causal or descriptive
- Evidence for
  - Argument/logic
  - Statistical tests
  - Figures or tables
- Read more than once
