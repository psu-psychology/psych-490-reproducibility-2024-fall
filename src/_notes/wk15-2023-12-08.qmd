## What is science, really? 

::: {.incremental}
- a **stock of accumulated knowledge** (facts & findings)
- a set of **characteristic methods** 

- a **set of cultural values** [@Merton1973-vf, p. 268]

## But lawful...

- [Fitts law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law)
- [Stevens' power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27s_power_law)

## And sometimes full of (f)laws

- Cognition is often [systematically biased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).
- Most current data are from WEIRD people [@Henrich2010-gf]
- Knowing what is and or is not a robust finding is *harder than it should be*

# Science matters...

## Advocate for science as

::: {.incremental}
- a **stock of accumulated knowledge** (facts & findings)
- a set of **characteristic methods** 
- a **set of cultural values** [@Merton1973-vf, p. 268]
- an **essential** tool for solving problems

- that can and should be strengthened 
- through rigorous, thoughtful criticism
:::

## As a producer...

- Commit to openly sharing your
  - data, protocols, code
  - from the very beginning
- Carry through on your commitment
- Encourage, help others
- Strive to get better

## As a consumer...

- Keep your skepticism sharp
- Ask how do we know that? Why do they think that?
- Data + reasoning
- Support policies, outlets, leaders who encourage openness, transparency
