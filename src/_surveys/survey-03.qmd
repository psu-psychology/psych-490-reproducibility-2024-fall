## Purpose

This page documents the data processing steps involved with Survey 03 in PSYCH 490.009.
The survey questions were adapted from those discussed in [@Chopik2018-wx].

The page also serves as a learning opportunity for exploring how to generate a set of plots using functional programming techniques.

## Our Survey

We show below three ways to link to the survey.

::: {.callout-note}

These are all equivalent, but we show them here to illustrate how this can be done.

The *long* URL that Google Forms provides can be shortened using the Google interface.
We use the shortened form to show the clickable link below.

:::

Link: <https://forms.gle/PFTGCMwmZZj1TtJS7>

### QR Code

```{r survey-qr}
survey_03_qr <- qrcode::qr_code("https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9w7CHjZD7jon1-_BsR_ZZHlIEVdKY0x4nJwh7v8AyXlpUmg/viewform?usp=sf_link")
plot(survey_03_qr)
```

## Preparation

First, we load the external packages (groups of R commands) that we will be using.

```{r include=FALSE}
library('tidyverse')
library('ggplot2')
library('dplyr')
library('tidyr')
library('stringr')
```

## Gathering

Next, we download the data from the Google Sheet where it is collected.
Dr. Gilmore has stored his Google account credentials in a special environment file that can be accessed by the R command `Sys.getenv("GMAIL_SURVEY")`.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
if (!dir.exists('csv')) {
  message("Creating missing `csv/`.")
  dir.create("csv")
}

if (params$update_data) {
  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv("GMAIL_SURVEY"))
  googledrive::drive_auth()
  
  googledrive::drive_download(
    "PSYCH 490.000 Fall 2023 Survey 03 (Responses)",
    path = "csv/survey-03-crewell-et-al.csv",
    type = "csv",
    overwrite = TRUE
  )
  
  message("Data updated.")
} else {
  message("Using stored data.")
}
```

The data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called `csv/`.

<!-- Note that there are five types of callouts, including note, tip, warning, caution, and important. -->

::: {.callout-note}

Because these data *might* contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub.
This is achieved by adding the name of the data directory to a special `.gitignore` file.

:::

## Cleaning

Next we load the data file and clean it.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
survey_03 <-
  readr::read_csv("csv/survey-03-crewell-et-al.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Google Forms puts the full question in the top row of the data file.
# We use the names() function to extract and print the original questions.
survey_03_qs <- names(survey_03)
survey_03_qs
```

### Clean/shorten names

For plotting and analyses, it's usually easier to shorten the questions by creating a short name that reflects the underlying idea or construct.
We'll use the `rename()` function from the `dplyr` package for this. 

```{r}
new_names <-
  c(
    "timestamp",
    "psych_problems_replicating",
    "replication_problem_psych_only",
    "incentives_undermine",
    "low_power_incorrect",
    "replicators_unqualified",
    "report_all_measures_important",
    "decide_n_before_important",
    "share_data_important",
    "collection_analysis_decisions_affect",
    "report_null_findings_important",
    "counterintuitive_results_important"
  )

# Swap out old (long) names for new (short) names
long_names <- names(survey_03)
names(survey_03) <- new_names
```

### Data dictionary

We'll pause here to start building a [data dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary), a file that explains the origin, format, and usage of our dataset.

```{r}
# Make new data frame with long and short names for reference
survey_03_data_dictionary <-
  tibble::tibble(q_long = long_names, q_short = new_names)

survey_03_data_dictionary |>
  knitr::kable(format = 'html') |>
  kableExtra::kable_classic()
```

We'll add other items to the data dictionary later.

## Visualizations

### Develop and test helper functions

I would like to retrieve the "long" form of the question from the data dictionary so that I can use it in my plots.

```{r}
# Retrieve the "long" question from the survey_03 data dictionary
retrieve_long_q <- function(this_q_short, data_dict = survey_03_data_dictionary) {
  assertthat::is.string(this_q_short)
  data_dict |>
    filter(q_short == this_q_short) |>
    select(q_long) |>
    as.character()
}

retrieve_long_q("psych_problems_replicating")
```

Then, I can create my own histogram function that can pull the specific data for a variable from the data frame.
And I wrap this in a second function that retrieves the long question name.

```{r}
my_hist <- function(data, var, q_long = "test") {
  data |>
    ggplot() +
    aes(x = {{var}}) +
    geom_histogram() +
    xlim(c(.5,5.5)) +
    ggtitle(q_long) +
    xlab("Rating")
}

my_hist_q <- function(var, data) {
  this_q <- retrieve_long_q(var)
  my_hist(data, .data[[var]], this_q)
}

my_hist_q(var = "replication_problem_psych_only", data = survey_03)
```

::: {.callout-note title="True confessions"}

I'm showing the final products above.
Creating and testing these took a little bit of time.

:::

Before we plot the data, let's remember what the scales look like:

![Response options for some questions in Survey 03](../include/img/strongly-disagree-strongly-agree.png){#fig-strongly-disagree-strongly-agree}

![Response options for some other questions in Survey 03](../include/img/not-important-very-important.png){#fig-not-important-very-important}
Now, we're ready to print histograms for all of the data.

```{r}
my_vars <- names(survey_03)[2:dim(survey_03)[2]]

purrr::map(my_vars, my_hist_q, survey_03)
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
purrr::map(my_vars, my_hist_q, survey_03)
```


::: {.callout-note title="To do"}

Some titles are too long to fit over the plots.
This should be fixed in a future version.

As one approach, I need a function that splits a long string by inserting a line feed `\n` character at the break point(s).

Another approach would be to generate Rmarkdown code that includes the long question as a figure caption (`fig.cap="My title"`).

:::

## Visualizations 2.0

Here, we try plotting the histograms again using principles we learned from metaprogramming.

Define the functions.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
my_freq_plot <- function(data = survey_03, var) {
  data |>
    ggplot() +
    aes(.data[[var]]) +
    geom_freqpoly(na.rm = TRUE,
                  show.legend = FALSE,
                  bins = 30) +
    xlim(c(.5, 5.5)) +
    xlab("Rating")
}

return_plot <- function(data, var) {
  knitr::knit_child(
    text = c(
      "### Histogram for: `{{var}}`",
      "\n",
      "```{r, echo = F}",
      "print(my_freq_plot(data, var))",
      "```"
    ),
    envir = environment(),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
}

return_section <- function(data, var) {
  chunk_hdr <- knitr::knit_expand(text = c("### Responses for: `{{this_var}}`",
                                           "\n"),
                                  this_var = var)
  
  # Build fig.cap from ground up
  fig_name <- paste0("fig-dist-", var)
  fig_cap <- paste0("'Distribution of responses to ", var, "'")
  fig_caption <- paste0("fig.cap = ", fig_cap)

  plot_chunk_hdr <- paste0("```{r ", fig_name, ", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, ", fig_caption, "}")
  
  plot_chunk <- c(plot_chunk_hdr,
                   "print(my_freq_plot(data, var))",
                  "```")
  
  question_long <-
    paste0("\nQ: '", retrieve_long_q(var), "'")
  
  knitr::knit_child(
    text = c(chunk_hdr, plot_chunk, question_long),
    envir = environment(),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
}
```

Run using `lapply()`.

```{r many-tables-lapply, results = "asis", warning=FALSE}
these_vars <- names(survey_03)[2:12]

res <- invisible(lapply(these_vars, return_section, data = survey_03))
cat(unlist(res), sep = "\n")
```

::: {.callout-note title="*Post hoc* thoughts"}

The keys to getting this to work were as follows:

1. In `return_chunk()`, generate separate text strings for the header (`chunk_hdr`), plot chunk (`plot_chunk`), and long question. See also the sequence for building a suitable string for `fig.cap`.

2. Combine these separate pieces within `knitr::knit_child()` with the `text=` parameter.

3. In `my_freq_plot()`, use the `aes(.data[[var]])` syntax to turn the string value for `var` into an unquoted variable in the dataset.

Bottom line: It's always better to bite off smaller chunks.
