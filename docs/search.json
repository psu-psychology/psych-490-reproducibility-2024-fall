Dr. Gilmore has stored his Google account credentials in a special environment file that can be accessed by the R command Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s vital to be very careful when creating and sharing code like this that involves sensitive information like login credentials.\nGilmore likes to put credentials in an .Renviron file that lives in his home directory. This is a recommended practice. On Mac OS and Linux, that’s ~/.Renviron. You can use the usethis::edit_r_profile() command at the R console (not the Terminal) to open your own .Renviron file. In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nHere, he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"), the value of those credentials is returned as a text string.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n\n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH 490.012: Survey 01: Openness and Trust in Science (Responses)\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n\n  )\n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub. This is achieved by adding the name of the data directory to a special .gitignore file."

We’ll use the rename() function from the dplyr package for this.\nWe first rename the variables from the “Openness to Revising One’s Viewpoint” subscale from the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale (Krumrei-Mancuso & Rouse, 2016).\n\n\nCode\nsurvey_01_clean &lt;- survey_01 |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    timestamp = \"Timestamp\",\n    when_shown_wrong = \"I have at times changed opinions that were important to me, when someone showed me I was wrong.\",\n    good_reason = \"I am willing to change my position on an important issue in the face of good reasons.\" ,\n    new_info = \"I am open to revising my important beliefs in the face of new information.\",\n    compelling_reason = \"I am willing to change my opinions on the basis of compelling reason.\",\n    mind_made_up = \"I’m willing to change my mind once it’s made up about an important topic.\",\n    comments = \"If you wish to comment about the questions in this survey, you may do so here. You are not required to comment. Your comments might be seen by others.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how the rename() function puts the ‘new’ name on the left and the ‘old’ name on the right.\nKeep in mind that the shorter names involve non-arbitrary choices. It’s good to keep the original questions close at-hand if you really want to understand what question people were asked.\n\n\nNow, we rename the variables from the (Nadelson et al., 2014) trust in science and scientists survey.\n\n\nCode\nsurvey_01_clean &lt;- survey_01_clean |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    ignore_contradictory_evidence = \"Scientists ignore evidence that contradicts their work.\",\n    theories_are_weak = \"Scientific theories are weak explanations.\",\n    keep_work_secret = \"Scientists intentionally keep their work secret.\",\n    dont_value_others_ideas = \"Scientists don't value the ideas of others.\",\n    dont_care_laypeople_understand = \"Scientists don't care if laypersons understand their work.\",\n    should_trust_work = \"We should trust the work of scientists.\",\n    should_trust_honesty = \"We should trust that scientists are being honest in their work.\",\n    should_trust_ethical = \"We should trust that scientists are being ethical in their work.\",\n    more_understanding_more_trust = \"People who understand science more have more trust in science.\",\n    trust_explain_natural_world = \"We can trust science to find the answers that explain the natural world.\",\n    cant_trust_biased = \"We cannot trust scientists because they are biased in their perspectives.\",\n    protect_each_other_when_wrong = \"Scientists will protect each other even when they are wrong.\",\n    wont_consider_contradictory_ideas = \"We cannot trust scientists to consider ideas that contradict their own.\",\n    sacrifice_others_to_advance = \"Today's scientists will sacrifice the well being of others to advance their research.\",\n    cant_trust_moves_slowly = \"We cannot trust science because it moves too slowly.\",\n    change_minds_undermines_trust = \"When scientists change their mind about a scientific idea it diminishes my trust in their work.\",\n    share_findings_dont_like = \"We can trust scientists to share their discoveries even if they don't like their findings.\",\n    make_life_better = \"I trust that the work of scientists is to make life better for people.\",\n    theories_trustworthy = \"Scientific theories are trustworthy.\",\n    hypotheses_just_guesses = \"When scientists form a hypothesis they are just guessing.\",\n    trust_find_tech_solutions = \"I trust scientists can find solutions to our major technological problems.\"\n  )\n\n\nNow, let’s look at the names to confirm they all got changed.\n\n\nCode\nnames(survey_01_clean)\n\n\n [1] \"timestamp\"                         \"when_shown_wrong\"                 \n [3] \"good_reason\"                       \"new_info\"                         \n [5] \"compelling_reason\"                 \"mind_made_up\"                     \n [7] \"change_minds_undermines_trust\"     \"ignore_contradictory_evidence\"    \n [9] \"theories_are_weak\"                 \"keep_work_secret\"                 \n[11] \"share_findings_dont_like\"          \"dont_value_others_ideas\"          \n[13] \"make_life_better\"                  \"dont_care_laypeople_understand\"   \n[15] \"should_trust_work\"                 \"should_trust_honesty\"             \n[17] \"should_trust_ethical\"              \"theories_trustworthy\"             \n[19] \"hypotheses_just_guesses\"           \"more_understanding_more_trust\"    \n[21] \"trust_explain_natural_world\"       \"trust_find_tech_solutions\"        \n[23] \"cant_trust_biased\"                 \"protect_each_other_when_wrong\"    \n[25] \"wont_consider_contradictory_ideas\" \"sacrifice_others_to_advance\"      \n[27] \"cant_trust_moves_slowly\"           \"comments\"                         \n\n\n\nData dictionary\nWe’ll pause here to start building a data dictionary, a file that explains the origin, format, and usage of our dataset.\n\n\nCode\nsurvey_01_data_dictionary &lt;-\n  tibble::tibble(\n    question = survey_01_qs,\n    short_name = names(survey_01_clean),\n    reference = c(\n      NA,\n      rep(\"krumrei-mancuso-2016\", 5),\n      rep(\"nadelson-2014\", 21),\n      NA\n    )\n  )\n\n\nWe’ll add other items to the data dictionary later.\n\n\nFiltering out irrelevant responses\nWe should omit the first response in the dataset.

This is a recommended practice. On Mac OS and Linux, that’s ~/.Renviron. You can use the usethis::edit_r_profile() command at the R console (not the Terminal) to open your own .Renviron file. In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nWhere he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls `Sys.getenv(“GMAIL_SURVEY”), the value of those credentials is returned.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n  \n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH 490.012: Survey 02: Scientific Values Survey (Responses)\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n  \n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub.

    "section": "Degrees of freedom",
    "text": "Degrees of freedom\nOne way to think about what’s going on here is that we analysts want an efficient way to summarize complex sets of data. Statistics like the mean or median, standard deviation, and correlation often do that. If a big set of data is well described by one of these statistics, then we’ve saved ourselves a lot of time and headache. If we think about a summary of some dataset as having \\(m\\) degrees of freedom, what we mean is that we only need \\(m\\) numbers for the summary. So, if we summarize a big dataset with the mean, then our summary (or model) has only one degree of freedom. If we include the standard deviation, then our summary has two degrees of freedom. If we use a linear regression to predict y ~ x then we usually have a slope estimate and an intercept estimate, or two degrees of freedom.\nIf we’re summarizing a raw dataset with \\(n=142\\) points in X and \\(n=142\\) datapoints in Y like the datasauRus sets above, being able to summarize with just a few numbers (degrees of freedom) is powerful and efficient. And in general, we analysts favor more parsimonious models of data–those with fewer degrees of freedom.\nThe problem arises when our simple models with few degrees of freedom don’t really capture important information about data sets, or when they persuade us to think (wrongly) that data sets with the same summary statistics are necessarily comparable. They might be, but they might not be. We have to look at the data–plot it–and confirm that we haven’t lost information in simplifying a dataset with a small number of statistics. The datasauRus and anscombe plots show us perverse situations when the small degree of freedom summaries are deeply misleading.\nThe converse is also true. We can describe a dataset increasingly precisely with a large number of degrees of freedom. For example, imagine that our model of one of the datasauRus sets has \\(2*n\\) degrees of freedom, where \\(n=142\\). If those 284 numbers are equal to the data points themselves, our summary has captured the data exactly. But we haven’t really gained anything, have we? We’ve just redescribed the data without reducing it to a summary with fewer degrees of freedom than existed in the first place. So, the best summaries (models) of data are small (in the number of degrees of freedom), but not too small."

    "text": "Researcher degrees of freedom\nWhen Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn (2011) discuss ‘researcher degrees of freedom’, they extend these ideas in a new direction. How many steps (degrees of freedom) did the analysts take to reach their conclusions? Ideally, as few as possible, and certainly far less than the number of data points.\nSo, how many researcher degrees of freedom are too many? That’s a judgment call. But whatever you determine, justify your argument. And maybe see whether the authors plotted their data in a way that helps make a case one way or the other."

Part 93”. the proposed research will address the need for education and resource development for individuals assisting with the handling of research misconduct allegations at the inquiry or investigation phases. To date, there has been no published research on this topic as most Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training emphasizes the prevention of research misconduct rather than the policy and processes that govern the handling of research misconduct allegations. The study team will conduct a needs assessment through benchmarking with other institutions to identify and prioritize the creation of educational materials and trainings. The study team will then use the needs assessment to create online modules to provide foundational knowledge of research misconduct processes, definitions, and procedures for inquiry officials and investigation committee members. The study team will then implement the newly created resources and seek feedback from the appropriate stakeholders. In addition, the study team will explore to what extent, if any, standing committees develop a deeper understanding of the research misconduct process. This will help to inform which, if either, committee type is more efficacious. Research on standing versus ad hoc committees is also lacking in the literature. This proposed research has the potential to positively impact the research integrity community at large with much needed tools, resources, training and research on the management of research misconduct allegations.\nhttps://ori.hhs.gov/blog/ori-awards-three-research-integrity-grants"

There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P &lt; .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.\n\n\n(Collaboration, 2015)"

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\n\nNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.\nReproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.\n\n\n(Collaboration, 2015)"

What does ‘sustained engagement’ in a topic have to do with trust?\nWhy does Feynman (1974) say ‘don’t fool yourself’? What could scientists fool themselves about? How can scientists avoid fooling themselves?\nExplain how science is both a set of facts and findings AND a set of tools and techniques. Do these aspects get equal attention? Are they equally important?\nWho should care about whether or not the public trusts science or scientists? Why should they care?\nHow did Mitroff (1974) change how we might think about Merton (1973)?\nDoes it matter whether scientific findings can be replicated by others? Why? Should scientists spend time to make their findings more easily replicable by others or put energy into making new discoveries?\nWhat should we conclude from Earp, Everett, Madva, & Hamlin (2014) replication attempt of the Zhong & Liljenquist (2006) study on the ‘Macbeth Effect’? In other words, what’s the ‘bottom line’?\nCan doing a simple task that ‘primes’ stereotypes about old people make young people walk more slowly? Under what conditions?\nWhat does a p-value provide information about? Why do psychologists care about them? What’s a common mistake many people make about p-values?\nWhat is p-hacking? Is it easy or hard to do? Is it a defensible or questionable?\nWhen is a retraction evidence of good/recommended scientific practices and when is it not?\nIs there consensus about what research practices are questionable? Is consensus important?"

Here is one description of it: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/five-paragraph-essay/. You can vary from this format as you gain experience, but if you’re struggling, this is a winning structure.\nGive your essay a title.\nWrite an introductory paragraph with a clear thesis statement. Here’s an example: “In this essay, I describe an allegation of scientific misconduct by Dr. Dietrich Stapel that led to a paper retraction from the journal X. In doing so, I describe the consequences for Dr. Stapel’s career in science and responses the scientific community has made to make similar situations less likely in the future.”\nWrite two or more paragraphs in the body of your essay. Each paragraph should describe a separate topic.\nWrite a short concluding paragraph where you summarize your key points."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the ideal world, we want large samples so that we can be confident that when we find differences between groups A and B (Americans and Europeans; males and females; soccer players and badminton players, etc.) that the differences we find are not due to chance. In the real world, there are always trade-offs between the size of the samples we can collect and our ability to avoid making mistakes about what’s true and what’s not.\nOne way to think about those trade-offs is to think about our situation this way:\nSome “fact” about the world can either be true or false, and our data analysis should inform us about whether the fact is either true or false. We want to be right as often as possible. That means having a way of deciding something’s true when it actually is true and deciding when something’s false when it actually is false. Both are important ways for our analysis to be correct.\nWe also want to avoid being wrong. We don’t want to decide something’s true when it’s not. That’s a false positive. We also don’t want to decide something’s false when actually it’s true. That’s called a false negative. We want to minimize both.\nTo avoid false positives, we decide how often we are willing to be wrong in that way and set a criterion accordingly. The alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) value or criterion reflects that choice. It’s a probability, so it’s between 0 and 1. Since we want the fraction of the time we make false negative decisions to be small, \\(\\alpha\\) is also usually small; \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is conventional, but it is not in any way sacred.\nTo avoid false negatives, we set another probability value, called beta (\\(\\beta\\)). Beta is the proportion of times we’re willing to conclude a true fact is actually false; \\(\\beta = 0.20\\), or 1 time out of five is conventional. But what data folks usually focus on is \\(1-\\beta\\)1 or statistical power. This number tells us the proportion of times we expect to detect a true effect when it’s actually there. Detecting the truth is sort of a scientific superpower, don’t you think? At least when things go right. Maybe that’s why \\(1-\\beta\\) is called power.\nAnalysts who are planning a study have two other decisions to make: How big a sample should they collect, and how sensitive should their test be? The answer to how big a sample should always be large, but how large? The answer is, of course, called \\(n\\). How sensitive is the test can be asked this way: What’s the smallest difference I want to be able to detect–assuming I’m interested in the difference between condition A and condition B? That difference between conditions is called the effect size because it might represent the effect of some intervention. If we think effect sizes with respect to the standard normal (bell-curve-shaped) distribution with mean mu (\\(\\mu=0\\)) and standard deviation sigma (\\(\\sigma=1\\)), we can specify it in terms of the number of standard deviations. Specified this way, the effect size is usually called \\(d\\). There are other ways to talk about effect sizes, but we won’t go further here.\nYour goals in this assignment are to see how choices about sample size (\\(n\\)), effect size (\\(d\\)), alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) relate to one another. You’ll explore the effects of different values for these parameters, report on the parameters you chose, and what the results turned out to be. There are no right or wrong answers."

    "text": "Your analysis\n\nWhen you first open the app, note that it simulates an analysis of groups A (red) and B, and that we get to control a number of parameters, including \\(n\\), \\(d\\), and \\(\\alpha\\). Note the statistics in the first gray box. It reports on the results of a \\(t\\) test, comparing the difference between the means of the two groups.\n\nInterpret the results of the t-test. What does it mean? What is the number in the brackets? What does it mean?\n“CI” means confidence interval. The CI has a minimum (leftmost) and maximum (rightmost) value. The actual difference in the observed means of A and B should fall inside the interval. In your own words, explain what the confidence interval means.\n\nLet’s see what happens when we generate different samples of A and B with the same underlying statistics–the same \\(n\\), same mean (\\(\\mu\\)), same standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), same effect size (\\(d\\)), and same criterion (\\(\\alpha\\)) or false positive rate.\n\nPress the Regenerate button. What happens to the histogram? Look in the grey t-test box. What happens to the t-test, and the mean values for A, B, the difference between A and B (B-A), and the CI?\nPress the Regenerate button a couple of times until Sig? changes from FALSE to TRUE or TRUE to FALSE? This is a form of p-hacking? Explain how. Remember the specific data we’re analyzing are being regenerated each time we press the button; what’s not changing is the sample size, standard deviation, and the effect size (difference between B and A).\n\nHaving \\(n=75\\) is a pretty large sample for many types of research in psychology, so let’s see what having smaller samples does to our t-test and to our power.\n\nBut before we do that, write down your prediction about what will happen to the t-test when we reduce the \\(n\\) for both groups A and B to 50.\nChange the \\(n\\) for A to 50 and the \\(n\\) for B to 50. Interpret the t-test and CI.\nWhat happened to power (see the box on the right side)? Does this mean we are more likely or less likely to detect a difference between A and B than before? Why?\n\nWe’re simulating what happens if there is an effect size of \\(d=0.5\\), or half a standard deviation between the means of A and B.\n\nChange \\(d\\) to 1.5 or larger. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\nChange \\(d\\) to 0.25. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\n\nLet’s see if we can find out what size of samples we’d need to have power \\(1-\\beta = 0.80\\) to detect an effect of (\\(d=0.25\\)). Increase the sample sizes of A and B until you exceed the desired level for power. What sample size did you need? Explain your finding.\n(Optional) Bonus Points (up to 5)\n\nExplore the effect of changing some other parameter on the results, for example, criterion/alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), the standard deviation for A or B (\\(\\sigma\\)), or even the ‘baseline’ mean for B (\\(\\mu\\)).\nReport on what you changed, what you observed, and what you conclude."

Sanctions for academic misconduct can include a grade of F for the course as well as other penalties.\nUnless you are told otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If I allow you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source.\nWhen you complete assignments, remember the ABCs to avoid plagiarism: Always place copied information within quotation marks, include information about the quoted or paraphrased source in a Bibliography, and Cite the source in the body (in the text) of your paper immediately after the quoted or paraphrased information. When in doubt, cite in the text and include the source in a bibliography.\nStudents with questions about academic integrity should ask me or the TA before submitting work.\nStudents facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour absence from class may be excused under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview for graduate school or a job, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class, you must contact the instructor and the TA in advance.\nUp to three (3) excused absences will be permitted.\n\n\n\nExercises submitted after the published deadlines will not be eligible for full credit unless the instructor has given specific permission.\n\n\n\nFinal projects submitted after the published deadline will not be eligible for full credit unless the instructor has given specific permission.\n\n\n\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.\nPenn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/), the Office of Student Affairs (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/), Career Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/), the Center for Women Students (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/), the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (http://titleix.psu.edu/), Penn State Educational Equity (http://equity.psu.edu/), the Multicultural Resource Center (http://equity.psu.edu/mrc), and University Health Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/).\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.\nDiscriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nDirect all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to:\nDr. Kenneth Lehrman III Vice Provost for Affirmative Action Affirmative Action Office The Pennsylvania State University 328 Boucke Building University Park, PA 16802-5901 Email: kfl2@psu.edu Tel (814) 863-0471\n\n\n\nThis classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.\nPenn State is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.\n\n\n\nPenn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point in the semester, I may decide to use Zoom to allow students who are unable to attend class in person to participate.\nWhile you are on Zoom, keep in mind that this is a classroom environment and others should be treated with respect. Please keep your microphone muted unless you want to ask a question or interact with someone. If your microphone is not muted, the entire class will be able to hear what is going on in your environment. As an instructor, I personally like to see people’s faces. As a participant, I am more involved when I have my camera on. I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not."

Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour absence from class may be excused under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview for graduate school or a job, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.\nIf you must miss class, you must contact the instructor and the TA in advance.\nUp to three (3) excused absences will be permitted.\n\n\n\nExercises submitted after the published deadlines will not be eligible for full credit unless the instructor has given specific permission.\n\n\n\nFinal projects submitted after the published deadline will not be eligible for full credit unless the instructor has given specific permission.\n\n\n\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Please refer to the information provided by Student Disability Resources (SDR) at http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/ for information about the procedures required to obtain reasonable accommodations in this course. Students should discussSDR-approved accommodations with their instructor as early in the semester as possible, even if they have taken another course with the instructor. Please note: students are not required to provide their instructor with information about the nature of their condition.\nPenn State students are also welcome to contact other units for assistance with personal concerns that interfere with academic progress, including: Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS; http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/counseling/), the Office of Student Affairs (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/), Career Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/career/), the Center for Women Students (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/womenscenter/), the LGBTQA Student Resource Center (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/lgbtqa/), the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response (http://titleix.psu.edu/), Penn State Educational Equity (http://equity.psu.edu/), the Multicultural Resource Center (http://equity.psu.edu/mrc), and University Health Services (http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/health/).\n\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons. It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.\nDiscriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated.\nDirect all inquiries regarding the nondiscrimination policy to:\nDr. Kenneth Lehrman III Vice Provost for Affirmative Action Affirmative Action Office The Pennsylvania State University 328 Boucke Building University Park, PA 16802-5901 Email: kfl2@psu.edu Tel (814) 863-0471\n\n\n\nThis classroom is a place where you will be treated with respect. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.\nPenn State is committed to creating an educational environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups and strives to create and maintain an environment that fosters respect for others as stated in Policy AD29 Statement on Intolerance.\n\n\n\nPenn State’s policies require me, as a faculty member, to share information about incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation) with Penn State’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless of whether the incidents are stated to me in person or shared by students as part of their coursework. For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point in the semester, I may decide to use Zoom to allow students who are unable to attend class in person to participate.\nWhile you are on Zoom, keep in mind that this is a classroom environment and others should be treated with respect. Please keep your microphone muted unless you want to ask a question or interact with someone. If your microphone is not muted, the entire class will be able to hear what is going on in your environment. As an instructor, I personally like to see people’s faces. As a participant, I am more involved when I have my camera on. I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not."

In this seminar, we will discuss whether there is or is not a reproducibility crisis in psychology and in science more broadly. We will discuss how initiatives to make scientific research more open and transparent can also make it more reproducible and robust."
