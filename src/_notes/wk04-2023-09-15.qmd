# Reproducible workflows with R, R Markdown, & Quarto

## Goals

::: {.incremental}
- Capture details of the research workflow
  - Not usually contained in journal articles, remember [@Artner2021-qg] comment from [last week](wk03-2023-09-08.html#artner-et-al-2021)?
- Make research notebooks that actually do work
  - Not just capture info passively
- Do so efficiently, flexibly
:::

## More goals

::: {.incremental}
- Make *computer* work harder
- Reduce manual work
  - More error-prone
- Save history of changes (e.g., version control)
- Make use of HTML and the web
- Keep track of (& cite) resources
:::

## Survey-01

- [Report](../survey-01.html)
- Goals
  - Measure trust in science and scientists
  - Measure individual characteristics that predict that trust
  - Do PSYCH 490.009 students follow patterns found by others [@Krumrei-Mancuso2016-qm; @Nadelson2014-ym; @Plohl2023-yf]?
  
## Survey questions

- Use [@Krumrei-Mancuso2016-qm; @Nadelson2014-ym; @Plohl2023-yf] questions.
- Shared [Google Form](https://forms.gle/Szk1pLEu4ZLWtFjX7)

---

::: {.callout-important}

**Q**: Why Google Form?

**A**: Easier than Qualtrics to generate, extract information from. 

Also, more broadly available (Google Forms is free to people with a Google account).

:::
  
## Gather & Clean Data

- Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org); [@quarto-site-gw].
- Successor to RStudio's R Markdown

## {background-iframe="https://quarto.org"}

## Quarto project

- Set of text files that combine
  - Notes
  - Code (in the R programming language)
  - Web links
  - Figures

Q: Why not MS Word or Google Doc?

Q: Why not MS Excel or MS PowerPoint?

## Purpose

This page documents the data processing steps involved with Survey-01 in PSYCH 490.009 Fall 2023.

The survey questions were adapted from those discussed in [@Krumrei-Mancuso2016-qm; @Nadelson2014-ym; @Plohl2023-yf].
````

::: {.incremental}
- First section with header title ("Purpose")
    - *Note*: the double hash/pound symbols "##" mean this is a level 2 header
    - You do use MS Word's styles, don't you?
- Short-hand names for the references with the "@" symbol
    - Quarto generates in-text citations and a bibliography for us!

## Survey

Direct link: <https://forms.gle/Szk1pLEu4ZLWtFjX7>

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScp2GG_2TZ3_T6Yl1okn-sHJF93n9RZu_EmLWQtHP0rJcGM3w/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="6003" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loadingâ€¦</iframe>
````

::: {.incremental}
- HTML links surrounded by "<>" become clickable in our output.
- the "<iframe..." comes from the Google Forms site. It embeds the actual survey in our document. 
    - No cutting and pasting!
:::

````
## Preparation

First, we load the external packages (groups of R commands) that we will be using.

```{{r}}
library('tidyverse')
library('ggplot2')
library('dplyr')
library('tidyr')
library('stringr')
library('lubridate')
library('GGally')
```

````

::: {.incremental}
- Another level 2 header
- And some R code in a "code chunk".
  - The brackets "{r}" tell the computer that we're speaking R to it.
  - We could also speak other languages like "{python}", etc.
:::

## Enough anatomy

- [Gathering](../survey-01.html/#gathering) (downloading data from Google)
- Cleaning
- Visualizing
- Making a [data dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary)

## Comparing this to other approaches...

## Let's look at [Survey-02](../survey-02.html)

![Summary figure from [Survey-02](../survey-02.html)](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-fall/survey-02_files/figure-html/fig-boxplot-norm-counternorm-1.png){fig-align="center"}
