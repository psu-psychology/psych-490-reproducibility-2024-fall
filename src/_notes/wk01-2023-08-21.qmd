## Purpose & goals

::: {.incremental}
- Evaluate the methods and values of scientific research
- Determine how well these methods and values yield reliable, robust findings
- Evaluate the reproducibility of findings in psychological science
- Understand what specific changes in practices are associated with open science
:::

## Themes & topics

::: {.incremental}
- What is science trying to do?
- What practices and norms constitute better science? 
- What practices and norms constitute poorer science?
- Is there a crisis of reproducibility or replicability in psychological science?
- Is there a crisis in other areas of science?
- What are scientists doing to address these criticisms?

## Trust in science

>"We trust too much in science and not enough in religious faith."

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

if (!dir.exists('csv')) {
  message("Creating missing `csv/`.")
  dir.create("csv")
}

      "No answer",
      "Don't know",
      "Strongly agree",
      "Agree",
      "Neither agree or disagree",

## Who trusts science?

>The results showed that political conservatism, religiousness, conspiracy ideation, and openness to experience significantly contributed to trust in science, while education did not. Furthermore, after controlling for these factors, an aspect of intellectual humility, openness to revising one's viewpoint, emerged as one of the key predictors of trust in science.

## Why should we care who trusts science & why they do or don't?
