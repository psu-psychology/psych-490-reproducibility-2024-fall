## Purpose & goals

::: {.incremental}
- Evaluate the methods and values of scientific research
- Determine how well these methods and values yield reliable, robust findings
- Evaluate the reproducibility of findings in psychological science
- Understand what specific changes in practices are associated with open science
:::

## Themes & topics

::: {.incremental}
- What is science trying to do?
- What practices and norms constitute better science? 
- What practices and norms constitute poorer science?
- Is there a crisis of reproducibility or replicability in psychological science?
- Is there a crisis in other areas of science?
- What are scientists doing to address these criticisms?
:::
