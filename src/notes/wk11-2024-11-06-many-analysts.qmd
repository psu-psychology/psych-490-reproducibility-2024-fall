>Empirical research inevitably includes constructing a data set by processing raw data into a form ready for statistical analysis. Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios.

@Steegen2016-qv

>Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.

>What if scientific results are highly contingent on subjective decisions at the analysis stage? In that case, the process of certifying a particular result on the basis of an idiosyncratic analytic strategy might be fraught with unrecognized uncertainty (Gelman & Loken, 2014), and research findings might be less trustworthy than they at first appear to be (Cumming, 2014). Had the authors made different assumptions, an entirely different result might have been observed (Babtie, Kirk, & Stumpf, 2014).

## Abstract

>Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Silberzahn2018-st
</p>

---

>Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship.

Odds ratios (OR) [@Szumilas2010-uj]:

- OR < 1: Outcome *less* likely than comparison
- OR = 1: Outcome and comparison equally likely
- OR > 1: Outcome *more* likely than comparison

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio) also has a thorough discussion.

>Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates.

>Note: The results shown are from the final survey. Each item concerned whether there is a relationship between players’ skin tone and the number of red-card decisions they receive. The response scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The items have been paraphrased for inclusion in the table.

>These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.

## Why the inconsistency?

>Our conjecture is that it was the unclear research question given to the teams. 

>Recall the research task that was set in the CSI: to find out whether players with dark skin tone are more likely to receive red cards than players with light skin tone. How would you interpret this research task? In our opinion, this verbal statement of the research question is quite diffuse.

[@Auspurg2021-um]

## What's your question? What's your model?

![Figure 1 from @Auspurg2021-um. ](https://journals.sagepub.com/cms/10.1177/23780231211024421/asset/images/large/10.1177_23780231211024421-fig1.jpeg)

## Your turn

::: {.callout-note}
## Your thoughts?

- So, are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players?
- How is this approach related to *p*-hacking?
- How does the many analysts approach conflict with current practice?
- When does this approach make sense and when doesn't it make sense?
- What about visualizing the data? Gilmore failed to see the effect, despite [trying](../supplemental/many-viz.qmd).
:::

## Conclusion from @Auspurg2021-um

>Applying sensitivity analyses to the result obtained with the CSI data, we demonstrated that the result of a modest racial bias in the likelihood of receiving a red card is quite sensitive to unobserved mediators. This indicates that this estimate, although consistent across many different model specifications, is probably not a true causal effect in itself.

>analyses with results that were far from the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those analyses that found results that were close to the mean. The existence of substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.

>...Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data.

>This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline.

>Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data.
