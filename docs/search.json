Dr. Gilmore has stored his Google account credentials in a special environment file that can be accessed by the R command Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s vital to be very careful when creating and sharing code like this that involves sensitive information like login credentials.\nGilmore likes to put credentials in an .Renviron file that lives in his home directory. This is a recommended practice. On Mac OS and Linux, that’s ~/.Renviron. You can use the usethis::edit_r_profile() command at the R console (not the Terminal) to open your own .Renviron file. In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nHere, he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"), the value of those credentials is returned as a text string.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n\n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH 490.012: Survey 01: Openness and Trust in Science (Responses)\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n\n  )\n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub. This is achieved by adding the name of the data directory to a special .gitignore file."

We’ll use the rename() function from the dplyr package for this.\nWe first rename the variables from the “Openness to Revising One’s Viewpoint” subscale from the Comprehensive Intellectual Humility Scale (Krumrei-Mancuso & Rouse, 2016).\n\nsurvey_01_clean &lt;- survey_01 |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    timestamp = \"Timestamp\",\n    when_shown_wrong = \"I have at times changed opinions that were important to me, when someone showed me I was wrong.\",\n    good_reason = \"I am willing to change my position on an important issue in the face of good reasons.\" ,\n    new_info = \"I am open to revising my important beliefs in the face of new information.\",\n    compelling_reason = \"I am willing to change my opinions on the basis of compelling reason.\",\n    mind_made_up = \"I’m willing to change my mind once it’s made up about an important topic.\",\n    comments = \"If you wish to comment about the questions in this survey, you may do so here. You are not required to comment. Your comments might be seen by others.\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice how the rename() function puts the ‘new’ name on the left and the ‘old’ name on the right.\nKeep in mind that the shorter names involve non-arbitrary choices. It’s good to keep the original questions close at-hand if you really want to understand what question people were asked.\n\n\nNow, we rename the variables from the (Nadelson et al., 2014) trust in science and scientists survey.\n\nsurvey_01_clean &lt;- survey_01_clean |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(\n    ignore_contradictory_evidence = \"Scientists ignore evidence that contradicts their work.\",\n    theories_are_weak = \"Scientific theories are weak explanations.\",\n    keep_work_secret = \"Scientists intentionally keep their work secret.\",\n    dont_value_others_ideas = \"Scientists don't value the ideas of others.\",\n    dont_care_laypeople_understand = \"Scientists don't care if laypersons understand their work.\",\n    should_trust_work = \"We should trust the work of scientists.\",\n    should_trust_honesty = \"We should trust that scientists are being honest in their work.\",\n    should_trust_ethical = \"We should trust that scientists are being ethical in their work.\",\n    more_understanding_more_trust = \"People who understand science more have more trust in science.\",\n    trust_explain_natural_world = \"We can trust science to find the answers that explain the natural world.\",\n    cant_trust_biased = \"We cannot trust scientists because they are biased in their perspectives.\",\n    protect_each_other_when_wrong = \"Scientists will protect each other even when they are wrong.\",\n    wont_consider_contradictory_ideas = \"We cannot trust scientists to consider ideas that contradict their own.\",\n    sacrifice_others_to_advance = \"Today's scientists will sacrifice the well being of others to advance their research.\",\n    cant_trust_moves_slowly = \"We cannot trust science because it moves too slowly.\",\n    change_minds_undermines_trust = \"When scientists change their mind about a scientific idea it diminishes my trust in their work.\",\n    share_findings_dont_like = \"We can trust scientists to share their discoveries even if they don't like their findings.\",\n    make_life_better = \"I trust that the work of scientists is to make life better for people.\",\n    theories_trustworthy = \"Scientific theories are trustworthy.\",\n    hypotheses_just_guesses = \"When scientists form a hypothesis they are just guessing.\",\n    trust_find_tech_solutions = \"I trust scientists can find solutions to our major technological problems.\"\n  )\n\nNow, let’s look at the names to confirm they all got changed.\n\nnames(survey_01_clean)\n\n [1] \"timestamp\"                         \"when_shown_wrong\"                 \n [3] \"good_reason\"                       \"new_info\"                         \n [5] \"compelling_reason\"                 \"mind_made_up\"                     \n [7] \"change_minds_undermines_trust\"     \"ignore_contradictory_evidence\"    \n [9] \"theories_are_weak\"                 \"keep_work_secret\"                 \n[11] \"share_findings_dont_like\"          \"dont_value_others_ideas\"          \n[13] \"make_life_better\"                  \"dont_care_laypeople_understand\"   \n[15] \"should_trust_work\"                 \"should_trust_honesty\"             \n[17] \"should_trust_ethical\"              \"theories_trustworthy\"             \n[19] \"hypotheses_just_guesses\"           \"more_understanding_more_trust\"    \n[21] \"trust_explain_natural_world\"       \"trust_find_tech_solutions\"        \n[23] \"cant_trust_biased\"                 \"protect_each_other_when_wrong\"    \n[25] \"wont_consider_contradictory_ideas\" \"sacrifice_others_to_advance\"      \n[27] \"cant_trust_moves_slowly\"           \"comments\"                         \n\n\n\nData dictionary\nWe’ll pause here to start building a data dictionary, a file that explains the origin, format, and usage of our dataset.\n\nsurvey_01_data_dictionary &lt;-\n  tibble::tibble(\n    question = survey_01_qs,\n    short_name = names(survey_01_clean),\n    reference = c(\n      NA,\n      rep(\"krumrei-mancuso-2016\", 5),\n      rep(\"nadelson-2014\", 21),\n      NA\n    )\n  )\n\nWe’ll add other items to the data dictionary later.\n\n\nFiltering out irrelevant responses\nWe should omit the first response in the dataset.

Consequently, these Principles do not constitute University policy and are not intended to interfere in any way with an individual’s academic or personal freedoms. We hope, however, that individuals will voluntarily endorse these common principles, thereby contributing to the traditions and scholarly heritage left by those who preceded them, and will thus leave Penn State a better place for those who follow.\nI will respect the dignity of all individuals within the Penn State community. The University is committed to creating and maintaining an educational environment that respects the right of all individuals to participate fully in the community. Actions motivated by hate, prejudice, or intolerance violate this principle. I will not engage in any behaviors that compromise or demean the dignity of individuals or groups, including intimidation, stalking, harassment, discrimination, taunting, ridiculing, insulting, or acts of violence. I will demonstrate respect for others by striving to learn from differences between people, ideas, and opinions and by avoiding behaviors that inhibit the ability of other community members to feel safe or welcome as they pursue their academic goals.\nI will practice academic integrity. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner. In accordance with the University Code of Conduct, I will practice integrity in regard to all academic assignments. I will not engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception because such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.\nI will demonstrate social and personal responsibility. The University is a community that promotes learning; any behaviors that are inconsistent with that goal are unacceptable.

I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not."

For more information regarding the University’s policies and procedures for responding to reports of sexual or gender-based harassment or misconduct, please visit http://titleix.psu.edu.\nAdditionally, I am required to make a report on any reasonable suspicion of child abuse in accordance with the Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point in the semester, I may decide to use Zoom to allow students who are unable to attend class in person to participate.\nWhile you are on Zoom, keep in mind that this is a classroom environment and others should be treated with respect. Please keep your microphone muted unless you want to ask a question or interact with someone. If your microphone is not muted, the entire class will be able to hear what is going on in your environment. As an instructor, I personally like to see people’s faces. As a participant, I am more involved when I have my camera on. I realize, however, that there are many reasons why you might not want to turn on your camera such as poor internet connection, joining via phone, or other privacy concerns. It is your choice as to whether you would like to have the camera on or not."

Here’s an example: “In this essay, I describe an allegation of scientific misconduct by Dr. Dietrich Stapel that led to a paper retraction from the journal X. In doing so, I describe the consequences for Dr. Stapel’s career in science and responses the scientific community has made to make similar situations less likely in the future.”\nWrite two or more paragraphs in the body of your essay. Each paragraph should describe a separate topic.\nWrite a short concluding paragraph where you summarize your key points."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn the ideal world, we want large samples so that we can be confident that when we find differences between groups A and B (Americans and Europeans; males and females; soccer players and badminton players, etc.) that the differences we find are not due to chance. In the real world, there are always trade-offs between the size of the samples we can collect and our ability to avoid making mistakes about what’s true and what’s not.\nOne way to think about those trade-offs is to think about our situation this way:\nSome “fact” about the world can either be true or false, and our data analysis should inform us about whether the fact is either true or false. We want to be right as often as possible. That means having a way of deciding something’s true when it actually is true and deciding when something’s false when it actually is false. Both are important ways for our analysis to be correct.\nWe also want to avoid being wrong. We don’t want to decide something’s true when it’s not. That’s a false positive. We also don’t want to decide something’s false when actually it’s true. That’s called a false negative. We want to minimize both.\nTo avoid false positives, we decide how often we are willing to be wrong in that way and set a criterion accordingly. The alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) value or criterion reflects that choice. It’s a probability, so it’s between 0 and 1. Since we want the fraction of the time we make false negative decisions to be small, \\(\\alpha\\) is also usually small; \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is conventional, but it is not in any way sacred.\nTo avoid false negatives, we set another probability value, called beta (\\(\\beta\\)). Beta is the proportion of times we’re willing to conclude a true fact is actually false; \\(\\beta = 0.20\\), or 1 time out of five is conventional. But what data folks usually focus on is \\(1-\\beta\\)1 or statistical power. This number tells us the proportion of times we expect to detect a true effect when it’s actually there. Detecting the truth is sort of a scientific superpower, don’t you think? At least when things go right. Maybe that’s why \\(1-\\beta\\) is called power.\nAnalysts who are planning a study have two other decisions to make: How big a sample should they collect, and how sensitive should their test be? The answer to how big a sample should always be large, but how large? The answer is, of course, called \\(n\\). How sensitive is the test can be asked this way: What’s the smallest difference I want to be able to detect–assuming I’m interested in the difference between condition A and condition B? That difference between conditions is called the effect size because it might represent the effect of some intervention. If we think effect sizes with respect to the standard normal (bell-curve-shaped) distribution with mean mu (\\(\\mu=0\\)) and standard deviation sigma (\\(\\sigma=1\\)), we can specify it in terms of the number of standard deviations. Specified this way, the effect size is usually called \\(d\\). There are other ways to talk about effect sizes, but we won’t go further here.\nYour goals in this assignment are to see how choices about sample size (\\(n\\)), effect size (\\(d\\)), alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) relate to one another. You’ll explore the effects of different values for these parameters, report on the parameters you chose, and what the results turned out to be. There are no right or wrong answers."

    "text": "Your analysis\n\nWhen you first open the app, note that it simulates an analysis of groups A (red) and B, and that we get to control a number of parameters, including \\(n\\), \\(d\\), and \\(\\alpha\\). Note the statistics in the first gray box. It reports on the results of a \\(t\\) test, comparing the difference between the means of the two groups.\n\nInterpret the results of the t-test. What does it mean? What is the number in the brackets? What does it mean?\n“CI” means confidence interval. The CI has a minimum (leftmost) and maximum (rightmost) value. The actual difference in the observed means of A and B should fall inside the interval. In your own words, explain what the confidence interval means.\n\nLet’s see what happens when we generate different samples of A and B with the same underlying statistics–the same \\(n\\), same mean (\\(\\mu\\)), same standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)), same effect size (\\(d\\)), and same criterion (\\(\\alpha\\)) or false positive rate.\n\nPress the Regenerate button. What happens to the histogram? Look in the grey t-test box. What happens to the t-test, and the mean values for A, B, the difference between A and B (B-A), and the CI?\nPress the Regenerate button a couple of times until Sig? changes from FALSE to TRUE or TRUE to FALSE? This is a form of p-hacking? Explain how. Remember the specific data we’re analyzing are being regenerated each time we press the button; what’s not changing is the sample size, standard deviation, and the effect size (difference between B and A).\n\nHaving \\(n=75\\) is a pretty large sample for many types of research in psychology, so let’s see what having smaller samples does to our t-test and to our power.\n\nBut before we do that, write down your prediction about what will happen to the t-test when we reduce the \\(n\\) for both groups A and B to 50.\nChange the \\(n\\) for A to 50 and the \\(n\\) for B to 50. Interpret the t-test and CI.\nWhat happened to power (see the box on the right side)? Does this mean we are more likely or less likely to detect a difference between A and B than before? Why?\n\nWe’re simulating what happens if there is an effect size of \\(d=0.5\\), or half a standard deviation between the means of A and B.\n\nChange \\(d\\) to 1.5 or larger. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\nChange \\(d\\) to 0.25. What happens to the histogram? What happens to our t-test and power?\n\nLet’s see if we can find out what size of samples we’d need to have power \\(1-\\beta = 0.80\\) to detect an effect of (\\(d=0.25\\)). Increase the sample sizes of A and B until you exceed the desired level for power. What sample size did you need? Explain your finding.\n(Optional) Bonus Points (up to 5)\n\nExplore the effect of changing some other parameter on the results, for example, criterion/alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)), the standard deviation for A or B (\\(\\sigma\\)), or even the ‘baseline’ mean for B (\\(\\mu\\)).\nReport on what you changed, what you observed, and what you conclude."

Dr. Gilmore has stored his Google account credentials in a special environment file that can be accessed by the R command Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s vital to be very careful when creating and sharing code like this that involves sensitive information like login credentials.\nGilmore likes to put credentials in an .Renviron file that lives in his home directory. This is a recommended practice. On Mac OS and Linux, that’s ~/.Renviron. You can use the usethis::edit_r_profile() command at the R console (not the Terminal) to open your own .Renviron file. In Gilmore’s case, he has added the following line to that file:\nGMAIL_SURVEY=\"&lt;my-google-account&gt;\"\nWhere he has substituted his Google account with credentials/access to the required files for &lt;my-google-account&gt;. Then, when the R code below calls `Sys.getenv(“GMAIL_SURVEY”), the value of those credentials is returned.\nMake sure to close and save the .Renviron file and restart your R session before testing this yourself.\n\n\n\nif (!dir.exists('csv')) {\n  message(\"Creating missing `csv/`.\")\n  dir.create(\"csv\")\n}\n\nif (params$update_data) {\n  options(gargle_oauth_email = Sys.getenv(\"GMAIL_SURVEY\"))\n  googledrive::drive_auth()\n  \n  googledrive::drive_download(\n    \"PSYCH 490.012: Survey 02: Scientific Values Survey (Responses)\",\n    path = file.path(\"csv\", params$fn),\n    type = \"csv\",\n    overwrite = TRUE\n  )\n  \n  message(\"Data updated.\")\n} else {\n  message(\"Using stored data.\")\n}\n\nThe data file has been saved as a comma-separated value (CSV) format data file in a special directory called csv/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause these data might contain sensitive or identifiable information, we only keep a local copy and do not share it publicly via GitHub. This is achieved by adding the name of the data directory to a special .gitignore file."
